## How to Run the SOAP Adapter
1. Move to `six-adapter-soap` directory  

	 ```
	 $ cd six-adapter-soap
	 ```
2. Build war using maven  

	 ```
	 $ mvn compile war:war
	 ```	 
3. A new folder named `target` will be created inside `six-adapter-soap` folder.  
Now, it should contain a war file named `six-adapter-soap-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war`  
4. Run GlassFish server:  

     ```
     PATH/TO/GLASSFISH/BIN/asadmin start-domain --domaindir /PATH/TO/GLASSFISH/DOMAINS -v [DOMAIN_FOLDER_NAME]
     ```
In my machine, the script looks like:
    ```
     Users/edmundophie/Downloads/glassfish4full/glassfish/bin/asadmin start-domain --domaindir /Users/edmundophie/Downloads/glassfish4full/glassfish/domains -v domain1
     ```
5. Go to GlassFish admin console at `localhost:4848`  
6. Select `Application` menu in the sidebar  
7. Select `Deploy...` button and locate the war file that we have just built  
8. To test the endpoint, you can go to  
`http://localhost:8080/six-adapter-soap-1.0-SNAPSHOT/SixAdapterService?Tester`  
 or use the `SOAP Client` program in `six-adapter-soap-client` folder  
9. WSDL can be viewed at  
 `http://localhost:8080/six-adapter-soap-1.0-SNAPSHOT/SixAdapterService?wsdl`
 
## How to Run the SOAP Client
1. Move to `six-adapter-client` directory  

	 ```
	 $ cd six-adapter-soap-client
	 ```
2. Build `jar` using maven `mvn`  

	 ```
	 $ mvn package
	 ```
2. Run `SixClient` from the generated `jar` in `target` folder  

	 ```
	 $ java -cp target/six-adapter-soap-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.edmundophie.client.SixClient
	 ```
3. Input your `Kode Prodi`, `Kode Mata Kuliah`, and `Kelas`

	 ```	 
3. A new folder named `target` will be created inside `six-adapter-rest` folder.  
Now, it should contain a war file named `six-adapter-rest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war`  
4. Run GlassFish server using:  

     ```
     PATH/TO/GLASSFISH/BIN/asadmin start-domain --domaindir /PATH/TO/GLASSFISH/DOMAINS -v [DOMAIN_FOLDER_NAME]
     ```
